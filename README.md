# FullScreenDialog

This project was implemented relying on the Android full-screen dialog in [Material Design](https://material.io/components/dialogs), 
as described in the Material Design tutorial. It's a simple fullScreen Loader AlertDialog.
For example please check app module's MainActivity.java class

With beautiful designs, you can open up new horizons every day by offering innovative and thoughtful 
concepts through creative tools, one of which is the customizable UI dialog design.

## The final result looks like this:
